For those seeking to pursue a career in surgery in Ireland, Core Surgical Training (CST) is a recommended first step. Streamlining of the pathway to Ireland’s specialist programme of Higher Surgical Training (HST) for imminent CST graduates who have completed their MRCS examinations has incentivised pursuit of this first step in Ireland.

Indeed, the vast majority of Irish consultant surgeons are graduates of the HST programme in Ireland. In recent years, applicants to HST (from the pool of roughly 100 CST Senior House Officers, or SHOs, in any given year) have been favoured for selection over those candidates applying from outside CST.

The window for RCSI CST applications opens in October and closes in November. The application process closely mirrors the CST programmes in the UK and Northern Ireland. There are also similarities in terms of duration (2 years) and format (first, a general surgical year, followed by a specialty-specific year). While the interview process is similar, there are some important differences which need to be considered. 

In this brief overview of the RCSI CST application process, we offer helpful guidance on the interview; what to expect and how to prepare. Any aspiring surgeon hoping to pursue a career in Ireland must understand the intricacies of the system given the ever-evolving requirements in terms of achieving targets and timelines in the preparation for applications and interviews.

## Targets and Timelines

Although rewarding, surgical training can be challenging. Good organisational and time-management skills are essential. Applications open in October every year and close in November. Seek to build your portfolio well in advance of the window for CST applications.

During recent years, roughly 500 people apply, 200 are shortlisted after eligibility screening for interview, and then 100 CST positions are allocated following interviews in February. RCSI CST positions have increased steadily: from 64 places in 2022, to 80 places in 2023, and we are now seeing 100 positions allocated every year from 2024 in line with growing surgical workforce demands in Ireland. This increase presents an opportunity for potential applicants if they can achieve the highest scores across their application to RCSI.

The standard set by RCSI for shortlisting occurs following an analysis of the October 2025 applications, centile scoring and an online surgical aptitude test. Shortlisting takes place prior to the release of offers for interviews in January, with interviews being conducted in February, and a selection process following prior to CST offers in March. After interview, candidate ranking and feedback are provided.

## Preparing for the Interview

Over recent years, the interview process has become more transparent with the introduction of a standardised format and scoring system based on the selection criteria for CST. One aiming to achieve a high score in the CST should pay close attention to the scoring system. A scoring matrix is available on the RCSI website (see table below). Doing well after interview is influenced to a large extent by targeting a high score in each specific competency domain. At interview, you should seek to sell your application across these scored areas; opening presentation, clinical judgement, interpersonal skills, professional development, and suitability for specialty training.

### Centile scoring

<div class="float--right" markdown="1">

| Range | Centile | Bucket |
| :---- | :-----: | :----: |
| 20    | 80-100  | 5      |
| 19    | 60-79   | 4      |
| 19    | 40-59   | 3      |
| 19    | 20-39   | 2      |
| 19    | 0-19    | 1      |

As part of your Core Surgical Training application, you must provide evidence of your centile or decile ranking as issued by your university.

A maximum of 5 marks is available for centile scores, with points awarded according to the ranking provided.

**Important Notes:**

- If you do not submit a centile or decile ranking, you will receive the minimum score of 1 mark.
- If your university does not issue centile or decile rankings, you must submit:
    - Your academic transcripts, and
    - An official letter from your university confirming that rankings are not provided.
- If both the transcripts and official confirmation letter are submitted, you will be awarded 2 marks.

## ‘Off the Table’

Achieving a competitive score after interview (out of 100 marks total) requires preparation and practice that should start as soon as possible. A combination of undergraduate academic record (5 marks) and surgical aptitude test (10 marks) are considered as ‘objective’ criteria utilised for 2 purposes: firstly, as a screening tool in the shortlisting process for interviews and, secondly, as part of the final score achieved after interview. 

After the surgical aptitude test, which usually takes place in December, one can no longer do anything about those first two criteria (15 marks in total). These will be ‘off the table’ for the purposes of interview preparation. 

Thus, 85 marks are ‘on the table’ at interview. In reality, many marks will have been guaranteed by one’s achievements’ across the various competency domains. Such achievements cannot be accumulated in the week prior to applications or interviews. Therefore, one should seek to begin preparation by presenting, publishing and profiling academic work as soon as possible.

## ‘On the Table’

Making a good first impression is key. Two consultant surgeons will ask questions across the competency domains with an external chairperson (also a consultant) overseeing and ensuring the fairness of the interview process. 

Doing well in the interview is very possible with good preparation and practice. Each candidate will be given the opportunity to sell themselves during a 2-minute opening presentation (worth 10 marks).

Clinical judgement and interpersonal skills will be assessed via two clinical scenarios, one for each competency respectively. These scenarios will be presented briefly by the interviewers and accompanied by questions that will be scored according to the strength of the answers given by the candidate. 

Professional development will encompass research, audit, presentations, publications, and any relevant qualifications while suitability for specialty training will be assessed more subjectively. Professionalism and specialty-specific ambitions within the field of surgery are assessed broadly with questions such as _“Where do you see yourself in 10 years’ time?”_. Many marks can be awarded for understanding the position for which you are applying and explaining why you should be selected above other candidates interviewing for the position. There are 30 marks available for this domain, and they are very much ‘up for grabs’ with how well you interview and sell yourself on the day.

## ‘Selling Oneself’

Selling oneself does not come naturally to most people, let alone doctors who spend much of their time listening and offering standard advice. It takes plenty of preparation and practice to exude ‘natural’ confidence, which will make one stand out from the crowd to the interviewers. Many candidates will invest in practice interviews with professional communication skills coaches. Given the standardised interview format and questions, there is no scope for ‘curveballs’ from the interviewers and one is advised to prepare standard answers to standard questions, as if the interview was a learnable exam. Be ready to give your strongest answers to questions that are largely predictable and you will be best placed to score highly in the interview.
